#The objective of this course is to:

- Understand and use *args and **kwargs to handle variable-length argument lists in functions
- Create and utilize generators to efficiently produce and manage large datasets or infinite sequences of data
- Apply Map, Filter, and Reduce functions to manipulate data in Python and make code concise and expressive
- Implement Decorators to modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their source code
- Utilize collections (such as namedtuple, deque, defaultdict, Counter, etc.) to efficiently handle and manipulate data structures.
- Understand the difference between iterations and comprehensions. Use list, dictionary and set comprehensions. Understand the impact on execution time
